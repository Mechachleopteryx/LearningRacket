# Queen Attack

I've already implemented both sequential and parallel versions of N-Queens, so this exercise is superfluous. Please see the following instead:

* [Sequential N Queens](https://github.com/lojic/LearningRacket/blob/master/miscellaneous/n-queens.rkt)
* [Parallel N Queens](https://github.com/lojic/LearningRacket/blob/master/miscellaneous/n-queens-parallel.rkt)
