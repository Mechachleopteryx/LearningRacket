# Learning Racket

The **Racket** programming language is amazing! I've decided to begin an intensive self-study program to master the language. I'll be writing a lot of code during this process, so I thought I'd create one large repository to contain it vs. numerous small repositories. I'll likely update this readme with more info as I progress.
